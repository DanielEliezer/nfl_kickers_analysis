Check out the medium post about this project: https://medium.com/@danieleliezer/nfl-kicker-analysis-a57e023088c1

In this project, the goal is to do an exploratory analysis in python to better understand the performance of NFL kickers. We'll try to answer some of the followings:  What are the best and worst teams in the NFL kicking the ball? And the best players? What is the probability of scoring as a function of goal distance? What's the average accuracy at the "field goal range"? Are the kickers improving their accuracy over the years? Do the kickers feel the pressure? How do their accuracy change when playing home vs away? And in pivotal moments? At what ages do the kickers hit their prime? 

The data was collected from this kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/toddsteussie/nfl-play-statistics-dataset-2004-to-present
